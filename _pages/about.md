## About Me
I am Alireza Arbabi, motivated computer engineering BSc. student at the [Department of ECE](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/ece) at the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) with GPA of 3.8/4. From summer 2023, I started to work as a research assistant at the [ACIS Lab](https://www.uvic.ca/research/labs/acis/index.php) at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/). My daily routine consists of swimming, exploring artworks (especially music and paintings), and works related to programming, mathematics, and researching.


## Research Interest

My research interest mainly focuses on various aspects of security and cryptography. The question that I'm enthusiastic to answer is how to leverage cryptography to make our systems more secure, from blockchain technology to artificial intelligence, and computer networks.
Until now, I've collaborated in 2 research activities as follows:
- **Evaluating mixing services in cryptocurrencies**: Our research focuses on investigating the obstacles and constraints within existing cryptocurrency mixing services. We analyze a range of mixers, including traditional ones in bitcoin and advanced ZKP-based mixers, as well as secure coins. The
objective is to assess the capabilities of each mixer and determine the most effective method for achieving anonymous mixing.
- **Designing a new blockchain consensus protocol based on the proof of activity (PoA)**: We were working on an alternative consensus protocol based on Proof of Activity to combine the benefits of using both the PoS
and PoA protocols and also reduce the power costs of the original PoA consensus. As a proof of concept, we implemented a
cryptocurrency for storing files (Blockchain-based Decentralized file sharing system) called Crystalline.

## Teaching

During the summer 2023, me and [AmirPasha Motamed](https://github.com/aamirpashaa) instructed the **Blockchain & Web3** course at the [University of Tehran ACM Chapter](https://ut-acm.ir/). Lectures, slides, and course syllabus are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1iHDbupD091NBzgU5VDBhY4xBb2VC4mFq). Also, the designed computer assignments of this course can be accessed through this [link](https://github.com/UT-ACM-Student-Chapter/Blockchain-SoC-Projects/tree/main) at GitHub.

## News
- April 2023: Our paper "RPoA: Redefined Proof of Activity" submitted to the IET Blockchain journal.
